Hello! Unfortunately the size of the data used for this demo is too big for github.

I created a google drive with the data instead: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwIERzbCdAXdbkxIdHM0Um42YnM

Please download the data and save it into the same directory as where you have "NLP_Demo.ipynb"

You will need to have the following libraries installed: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Beautiful Soup, NLTK, gensim

Cheers!

Jordan
