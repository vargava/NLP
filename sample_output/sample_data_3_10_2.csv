We are looking for someone to share our awesome, quiet home with us on the border of Oakland and San Leandro. 

There are 3 of us - a 30-something couple with 2 sweet dogs, and a 40-something professional female working on her PhD, looking for a roommate starting April 1st! The bedroom is bright yellow, fully furnished and quaint with tall ceilings. You would be sharing the bathroom with 1 lovely female. The room is about 100 square feet with new carpet and a large closet.

We have an updated kitchen with new appliances that you're welcome to use at your leisure. We also have a washer/dryer in the unit.

Our two dogs are well behaved, but we'd need someone who is comfortable around medium-sized dogs. Unfortunately, our HOA limits us to 2 pets, so we are unable to accept more pets at this time.

We are not big partiers but have friends over occasionally for dinner/drinks/workouts. We are pretty quiet, chill people and would hope the same from you. We like to go out, but we definitely prioritize our job, school, and doggies! 

There is guest parking in front as well as a shared lot owned by our complex. Rent is $950 and includes all utilities (water, PG&E, cable and WiFi), as well as a $500 deposit.

If interested, please send us a little bit about yourself!

The space:
the living space offered is a loft-like area that is in the back of the living room, and can be technically closed off using dividers. It comfortably fits a queen bed (with a brand new memory foam mattress) and a huge wall closet (see picture).

The apartment is fully furnished: sofa, big tv, eating area, fully decked kitchen. For this type of space its as good as it gets in terms of privacy and separation from the rest of the apartment. We are sharing the common space and privacy and boundaries are respected. 

Apartment stuff:
laundry w/d in the building. Fast wifi, big tv, PS4, fully furnished living room. its a nice place, perfect for commuters who need to just bring a luggage


About me: Im a 32 year old, gay guy, very friendly, accommodating and open minded. I work during most of the week in San Mateo (M-F).

About you: 
no pets or smokers (smoke detector in the apt), no drugs of any kind. Occasional over night guests are fine, though the space isnt really suitable for that. There is parking in the st. or you can rent a spot from the complex (~$250/mo). Age unimportant, but be a responsible adult and respect the space. I prefer gay roommates but not a must (though you gotta be gay friendly :).

The area: Fillmore/Ofarrell st, lots of restaurants, SF Fitness, walking distance to Kabuki theatre and Japan town mall.

Our roommate of over a year is moving out to live with his girlfriend and we have a room available in our three bedroom home.  The room is available April 1st, but we are able to work with this date, if an earlier move is needed.

Location:

Residence is located in west Redwood City, on the boarder of Menlo/Atherton, close to Woodside Road and Alameda de las Pulgas.  Neighborhood is very safe, quiet and residential with friendly families as neighbors.  You'll see individuals jog, run or bike the neighborhood, as it's a nice area and homes are well taken care of.  The attached photo does not do enough justice to how pristine the neighborhood actually is.

It's also located 4 miles from Stanford University, downtown Palo Alto, Stanford Shopping and less than 10 minutes to downtown Redwood City.  Freeway access to 280 and 101 are 5 minutes away.  Woodside Road is two blocks away.

Residence:

The residence is a single-family home with three bedrooms and one shared bathroom.  Two of the rooms are currently rented.  The residence common areas are furnished and there is a full kitchen, front yard and backyard.  There is also a washer/dryer in the garage and a one car garage that is used as storage space.  Parking is available on our driveway and front of our house on a first-come, first serve basis between the roommates.  Street parking has never been an issue and there is ample parking available throughout the day and evening times.

Internet, electricity, water, garbage and common household items are split three ways.  The cost of utilities are usually about $100 per month, however, these figures will vary during the winter months when we use our heater.   We also have a gardener and a housekeeper, which is included in the split costs of $100.

The monthly rent is $1075 and deposit is $1200.  Rent is managed through a management company, so a credit check and application is needed to apply.  There is no minimal contract timeframe to sign, we are on a month-to-month basis.  Unfortunately, we cannot allow pets.

Roommates:

There are two roommates you'll be living with.  We're both in our 30s.  The first roommate is a male, long-standing employee at Stanford University.  He is a Bay Area native and loves all types of music.  The second is a female, government employee, well-travelled, Bay Area native and loves Latin ballroom dancing.

We're both professionals and very considerate of one another.  This residence is perfect for someone seeking a quiet home to study or relax in.  We both are friendly, but also have busy social calendars.  

Summary:

Ideally, we'd like to have someone seeking a long-term housing need, but are open to various commitment lengths.  For the price, location and quality of roommates, this offer is truly a steal.

Please respond to the craigslist ad email, if you're interested in the room.  

This ad will be posted more than once on craigslist and via other room sharing outlets, as we are seeking to fill the room fairly quickly.  If you see this ad, the room is still available.

I tend to keep to myself, but can also be chatty from time to time. I don't have many people over, I tend to do my socializing outside the home, and would prefer someone the same. I don't smoke, and rarely drink. I'm a pretty liberal lady, lgbtq and all friendly. I dig music, art, history, and useless trivia.

Rent $450/month (and includes internet, water, electric, and some baked goods I snag from work!) The house has a washer/dryer, dishwasher, wood burning fireplace, and a beautiful deck. I have some bedroom furniture if needed. Also, parking is never an issue in the neighborhood. You can always find street parking, and I also have a parking pad out back that I never use. I am also a block away from a few bus lines, and the Hopkins shuttle is about a 10 minute walk.

Ideally I'm looking for someone starting mid April, but may be able to make earlier arrangements if necessary. You don't have to be a super neat freak, just make sure to clean up after yourself. A dish in the sink left overnight is okay, but I may start to get annoyed if it's much longer.

We are looking to fill a vacancy in our 3br/2br apartment - available April 1st.
The room comes partially furnished - it includes a queen bed and if you want it, a six-drawer dresser.

About the apartment:
We live on the second floor of a three-unit building overlooking Judah St. The N stops right outside our door, so it's convenient getting downtown (~35min) or a bunch of other neighborhoods across the city. We share a garage with the other tenants, and share a parking space amongst ourselves. We've got our own washer/dryer, a good sized kitchen, a large living room / dining room area. We don't have cable, so utilities generally run us ~$40/mo per person.

About the neighborhood:
The sunset is a quiet, laid-back neighborhood. We have a convenience store downstairs and a couple restaurants on the block, and most everything else is available a few blocks away on the Irving St corridor. Plenty of parking all around and only two blocks from golden gate park - its amazing!!

About the roommates:
We're two guys in our mid to late 20s who have been living in this unit for the past three years. We love our apartment and we love the sunset, so we're looking for someone who shares that same enthusiasm. In many ways we embody the neighborhood - we're no-frills, low-stress, easy going. We enjoy each other's company and hope the same can be said for our new roommate. We're huge into music and make a lot of it ourselves at home; other things we love include breakfast, baseball, bikes, and the couple who owns the corner store beneath us - nothing like a friendly relationship with the people who sell you your beer :). We host friends, but rarely parties.

They should be officially moving into their new place on 4/1, but we could make 3/15 work or any other date during March potentially. 

About me: 30 year old female working in a tech company with a health care bent. I love yoga and generally being active. Been in SF for 4 years now. Recently adopted a 4 year old small dog who is the chillest and sweetest (barely barks). I have a boyfriend and tend to stay over at his place over mine. Looking for a roommate who respects the space as much as I do and won't bring the party home. Occasional guests are fine. My prior roommates and I would just give each other a heads up.

Photos of the room which is 10x10, living room, and dog attached!

Other info-- 
1. Parking: Located in attached garage below complex. $200 per month separate from rent.
2. Bathroom: We'd share the common bathroom (though really, I only use it for showers mainly), as I have my own half bath that I use.
3. Kitchen perks: Garbage disposal and dishwasher. Enough room for 2 people to cook.
4. Other perks: Super convenient and walkable. A block away from Whole Foods (and Trader Joe's is 4 blocks away), 2 blocks from Lafayette Park, 15 min walk to Union St. up North and 15 min walk to Fillmore St. to the West.
5. Furnishings: My place is furnished in the common spaces, but the bedroom that's available isn't. 
6. Other dogs/cats allowed? Unfortunately not, per Property Management, plus I'm allergic to cats. :(
7. Perks about the complex: It's gated for security. There's a pool and sauna in the courtyard, as well as a communal storage room in the basement.

THE ROOM
I can't tell you how much I've LOVED this room. I'm moving out so I can move in with my boyfriend. There's no way I'd leave it otherwise.  

*The lighting is perfect. 
*It's bright, open, and incredibly spacious. I even have room for a coffee table and chair, and still have floor space for yoga/working out.

*The closet is ENORMOUS. At least twice the size of a normal closet.
*It's carpeted, so it's nice and cozy
*Oh, and you get your own patio, which is the size of around 2.5 parking spots, and overlooks Golden Gate Park.

You'd be sharing the apartment (not the room) with two 27 year old women. They share the second bedroom of the 2 BR apartment. They're both healthcare students (Nursing and Dentistry) and are incredibly sweet and kind. 

THE APARTMENT
*One bathroom with a shower/tub (we always ask each other if it's ok if we shower, before hopping in)
*Full kitchen (minus a dishwasher, but that's SF)
*Dining area
*Living room
*Patio off the dining area/living room
*Coin-op Laundry in the building

I have some bedroom furniture if needed. Also, parking is never an issue in the neighborhood. You can always find street parking, and I also have a parking pad out back that I never use. I am also a block away from a few bus lines, and the Hopkins shuttle is about a 10 minute walk.

Ideally I'm looking for someone starting mid April, but may be able to make earlier arrangements if necessary. You don't have to be a super neat freak, just make sure to clean up after yourself. A dish in the sink left overnight is okay, but I may start to get annoyed if it's much longer.

We are looking to fill a vacancy in our 3br/2br apartment - available April 1st.
The room comes partially furnished - it includes a queen bed and if you want it, a six-drawer dresser.

About the apartment:
We live on the second floor of a three-unit building overlooking Judah St. The N stops right outside our door, so it's convenient getting downtown (~35min) or a bunch of other neighborhoods across the city. We share a garage with the other tenants, and share a parking space amongst ourselves. We've got our own washer/dryer, a good sized kitchen, a large living room / dining room area. We don't have cable, so utilities generally run us ~$40/mo per person.

About the neighborhood:
The sunset is a quiet, laid-back neighborhood. We have a convenience store downstairs and a couple restaurants on the block, and most everything else is available a few blocks away on the Irving St corridor. Plenty of parking all around and only two blocks from golden gate park - its amazing!!

About the roommates:
We're two guys in our mid to late 20s who have been living in this unit for the past three years. We love our apartment and we love the sunset, so we're looking for someone who shares that same enthusiasm. In many ways we embody the neighborhood - we're no-frills, low-stress, easy going. We enjoy each other's company and hope the same can be said for our new roommate. We're huge into music and make a lot of it ourselves at home; other things we love include breakfast, baseball, bikes, and the couple who owns the corner store beneath us - nothing like a friendly relationship with the people who sell you your beer :). We host friends, but rarely parties.

They should be officially moving into their new place on 4/1, but we could make 3/15 work or any other date during March potentially. 

About me: 30 year old female working in a tech company with a health care bent. I love yoga and generally being active. Been in SF for 4 years now. Recently adopted a 4 year old small dog who is the chillest and sweetest (barely barks). I have a boyfriend and tend to stay over at his place over mine. Looking for a roommate who respects the space as much as I do and won't bring the party home. Occasional guests are fine. My prior roommates and I would just give each other a heads up.

Photos of the room which is 10x10, living room, and dog attached!

Other info-- 
1. Parking: Located in attached garage below complex. $200 per month separate from rent.
2. Bathroom: We'd share the common bathroom (though really, I only use it for showers mainly), as I have my own half bath that I use.
3. Kitchen perks: Garbage disposal and dishwasher. Enough room for 2 people to cook.
4. Other perks: Super convenient and walkable. A block away from Whole Foods (and Trader Joe's is 4 blocks away), 2 blocks from Lafayette Park, 15 min walk to Union St. up North and 15 min walk to Fillmore St. to the West.
5. Furnishings: My place is furnished in the common spaces, but the bedroom that's available isn't. 
6. Other dogs/cats allowed? Unfortunately not, per Property Management, plus I'm allergic to cats. :(
7. Perks about the complex: It's gated for security. There's a pool and sauna in the courtyard, as well as a communal storage room in the basement.

I'm looking for a roommate to take up the other room in this 2-Bedroom 1-Bath Apartment. Here are the few details about the place:
- Rent is $1,160 per month. We would split utilities (about $120 a month). So total cost would be around $1,220 per month.
- The location is hard to beat. It is right in the heart of Rockridge. Less than a 5-minute walk to Trader Joe's and the Rockridge BART Station.
- Coin-operated laundry room in the building.
- Street parking with a City Permit. We also have one covered parking spot.
- Bedroom is unfurnished. As for the living room, we currently have a couch (can be kept or put in storage); we'll have a table in the next couple of days. 
- To move in, you would send in an application to the property manager (fee of $25 I think). Once you are approved, your name would get added to the lease as an addendum. You need first month's rent ($1,160) and a deposit ($1,100). So total of $2,260.
- No pets (sorry).

A little about me: 30, male, civil engineer, fairly laid back, I'm big into running and triathlons, I try to keep the common areas clean.

About you: preferably male, can pay bills on time, doesn't bring the party home, no hard drugs, can keep the common areas relatively clean

Send me something about yourself so we can schedule a time for you to see the place. I'm looking to fill the spot ASAP. If you need more information, let me know.

Pictures to follow.

what we have here is  sort of an in-law type unit located behind the main house, it is not what you would call deluxe but what it lacks there it more than makes up for in that:

Location is Great, located 5 minutes from 680 freeway a few blocks off Mckee Rd  inbetween McKEE AND Alum Rock, Takes less than 15 minutes to get downtown.

1) It has a private entrance
 
2) while most places dont let you smoke, I am smoker friendly  both 420 and cigs, so if smoke bothers you, dont call.

3) you may cook with micro or  hot plate in your room but the kitchen in the main house is available for your use as long as you clean up after

4) the unit is located in a gated area behind main house so it very safe. 

5) if you are a light sleeper or have to be  up very early  you proably should not call. Im up late a lot and  not always that quiet and i live in the other half of the unit. each side is seperate from the other the other though with its own entrance. 

6) while I am up late sometimes and not always that quiet  we are not partyers here and will not tolerate someone that is. I have very few people over and expect the same from you. 

7) the room is about 15x 15 with a smaller half room before it when you walk in. 

8) like I said this place is not deluxe but it comes with a lot of freedom you wont find inside someones home where you cant smoke or cook and are basically walking around on eggshells all the time,

9) and all this can be yours for only $1200 a month  , no lease its month to month  and if you cause any problems it will be just a month,  like I said,  NO PARTYERS  AND VERY LITTLE TRAFFIC. 

10) Requiring first months rent  a $500 dollar deposit and proof of job or of income.

Recently featured in Popsugar magazine.

THE PLACE 
The building is a small beautiful Victorian. The lower unit is home to the famous Asta Yoga Studio (definitely worth trying!) 
The place blends the charm of Victorian interiors with the energy of bright colors and a gigantic, inspiring artist loft space. It has gorgeous, newly-remodeled kitchen and bathroom, a one-of-a-kind artist studio, a spa-like bathroom, a private and sunny deck, a large living space, spacious bedrooms, and high-speed internet access. Four-side exposure give it magnificent light throughout the day. The colorful design, eclectic art and eco-burning fireplace make it a perfect hangout. 

Other amenities:

- Private deck with lots & lots of sun
- Gigantic, sunny artist loft
- High-speed internet
- Laundry downstairs

THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Pretty simple: this is as central and trendy as it gets. The Valencia corridor is a fun and lively neighborhood with some of the best cuisine and culture the city has to offer.
Within walking distance, you'll find excellent restaurants, gourmet coffee shops, parks, and trendy bars and nightlife:
* Around the corner are Four Barrel Coffee, Pauline's Pizza, Mission Beach Cafe
* 3 short blocks away are Limon Rotisserie, Monk's Kettle, Armory Club, Whole Foods and Zuni Cafe
* 5 short blocks away are Tacolicious, Delfina, Tartine Bakery, and Bi Rite Market
* The list goes on, and seems to grow daily... 
* It's a 5-min walk to Dolores Park (maybe the best park in the city)

GETTING AROUND
It's super easy to get around town: 
* You're 1-3 short blocks from public transportation, including BART, MUNI and many of the major bus lines for easy access to SFO, Union Square, Moscone Center, the Castro, Market Street, the Ferry Building, AT&T Park, everywhere! 
* It's a fantastic neighborhood for bicycling, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th St. 
* Parking can be difficult. (There is a parking garage around the corner, ~$20/day.)",TRUE,TRUE,False,True,TRUE,True,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Would you like to live in a stunning 3,500 square foot Luxury Home located in one of the best and most prestigious neighborhoods in the United States according to Forbes Magazine? I have decided to further my education and attend Law School full-time so I would like to share my gorgeous DANVILLE home (which I have owned since 1991) with a few carefully chosen, friendly and accommodating individuals who want to experience affordable luxury living in the Blackhawk area for less than apartment prices. Each luxurious room is extraordinarily large, freshly re-carpeted, newly re-painted, has a fairly spacious walk-in closet, has wireless high-speed internet connection, cable hook-up, central air conditioning/heating, and cathedral ceilings. It's a place you would be proud to let your friends and colleagues know you live there. Your future home and residence is conveniently located within a block or two away from a Safeway, a CVS pharmacy, Blackhawk Plaza, Blackhawk Movie Theater, many fine restaurants and fast food establishments, a huge community pool (great for doing laps), a park, 3 baseball diamonds, 3 soccer fields, a beach sand volleyball court and a basketball court. You will be within 5 to 15 minutes away Major Freeways (680, 580, 880 and 24 and from the Dublin or the Walnut Creek BART Stations for those who have to commute. You also will be living less than 2 miles from Diablo Valley Community College (DVC) San Ramon Campus for those who want to further their education. For those who love to jog, hike, mountain bike, camp or star gaze, you will be within 5 minutes from the foot of Mount Diablo which is one of the highest peaks in California. Sorry but...NO SMOKERS, OVERNIGHT GUESTS OR PETS...just not a good idea in a multi-tenant shared housing environment. Because I will also be living in the same household as you will be, please be rest assured that I will do my best to make sure that only warm, considerate and trustworthy housemates will be welcomed to live with us.


REMEMBER...YOU ARE NOT JUST RENTING A ROOM since you will have access to and use of ALL the common areas of the house, property and community facilities. This means you will also have the FULL benefits of living in a fantastic 3,500 square foot luxury home with all the amenities and prestige that comes with it which you can never get living in an apartment. It's like renting a WHOLE Luxury Home for the relatively small rent you'll be paying...Isn't that a bargain by any standard? 


A credit and background check and a Tenant risk assessment will determine the level of REFUNDABLE security deposit that will be required - one month's rent for low risk and two month's rent for a higher risk. I am willing to consider applicants who are credit challenged. An annual lease term agreement is the preferred and the standard lease term although shorter lease terms will be considered upon request but only in special circumstances. The cost of all Utilities and WEEKLY maid/maintenance services shall be equally divided among all occupants (around $250 for each occupant per month which includes cable and high-speed/broadband wireless internet and WEEKLY maid/maintenance services that cleans the whole house including your room and bathroom and maintains the grounds). That means you will have no weekly chores to do for yourself or for the household and you don't have to buy all those expensive cleaning tools and supplies which will leave you with more time to rest and enjoy your time off from work. Isn't that a luxury we all want and deserve?",TRUE,TRUE,False,True,TRUE,True,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE

THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Pretty simple: this is as central and trendy as it gets. The Valencia corridor is a fun and lively neighborhood with some of the best cuisine and culture the city has to offer.
Within walking distance, you'll find excellent restaurants, gourmet coffee shops, parks, and trendy bars and nightlife:
* Around the corner are Four Barrel Coffee, Pauline's Pizza, Mission Beach Cafe
* 3 short blocks away are Limon Rotisserie, Monk's Kettle, Armory Club, Whole Foods and Zuni Cafe
* 5 short blocks away are Tacolicious, Delfina, Tartine Bakery, and Bi Rite Market
* The list goes on, and seems to grow daily... 
* It's a 5-min walk to Dolores Park (maybe the best park in the city)

GETTING AROUND
It's super easy to get around town: 
* You're 1-3 short blocks from public transportation, including BART, MUNI and many of the major bus lines for easy access to SFO, Union Square, Moscone Center, the Castro, Market Street, the Ferry Building, AT&T Park, everywhere! 
* It's a fantastic neighborhood for bicycling, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th St.

Would you like to live in a stunning 3,500 square foot Luxury Home located in one of the best and most prestigious neighborhoods in the United States according to Forbes Magazine? I have decided to further my education and attend Law School full-time so I would like to share my gorgeous DANVILLE home (which I have owned since 1991) with a few carefully chosen, friendly and accommodating individuals who want to experience affordable luxury living in the Blackhawk area for less than apartment prices. Each luxurious room is extraordinarily large, freshly re-carpeted, newly re-painted, has a fairly spacious walk-in closet, has wireless high-speed internet connection, cable hook-up, central air conditioning/heating, and cathedral ceilings. It's a place you would be proud to let your friends and colleagues know you live there. Your future home and residence is conveniently located within a block or two away from a Safeway, a CVS pharmacy, Blackhawk Plaza, Blackhawk Movie Theater, many fine restaurants and fast food establishments, a huge community pool (great for doing laps), a park, 3 baseball diamonds, 3 soccer fields, a beach sand volleyball court and a basketball court. You will be within 5 to 15 minutes away Major Freeways (680, 580, 880 and 24 and from the Dublin or the Walnut Creek BART Stations for those who have to commute. You also will be living less than 2 miles from Diablo Valley Community College (DVC) San Ramon Campus for those who want to further their education. For those who love to jog, hike, mountain bike, camp or star gaze, you will be within 5 minutes from the foot of Mount Diablo which is one of the highest peaks in California. Sorry but...NO SMOKERS, OVERNIGHT GUESTS OR PETS...just not a good idea in a multi-tenant shared housing environment. Because I will also be living in the same household as you will be, please be rest assured that I will do my best to make sure that only warm, considerate and trustworthy housemates will be welcomed to live with us.


REMEMBER...YOU ARE NOT JUST RENTING A ROOM since you will have access to and use of ALL the common areas of the house, property and community facilities. This means you will also have the FULL benefits of living in a fantastic 3,500 square foot luxury home with all the amenities and prestige that comes with it which you can never get living in an apartment. It's like renting a WHOLE Luxury Home for the relatively small rent you'll be paying...Isn't that a bargain by any standard? 


A credit and background check and a Tenant risk assessment will determine the level of REFUNDABLE security deposit that will be required - one month's rent for low risk and two month's rent for a higher risk. I am willing to consider applicants who are credit challenged. An annual lease term agreement is the preferred and the standard lease term although shorter lease terms will be considered upon request but only in special circumstances. The cost of all Utilities and WEEKLY maid/maintenance services shall be equally divided among all occupants (around $250 for each occupant per month which includes cable and high-speed/broadband wireless internet and WEEKLY maid/maintenance services that cleans the whole house including your room and bathroom and maintains the grounds). That means you will have no weekly chores to do for yourself or for the household and you don't have to buy all those expensive cleaning tools and supplies which will leave you with more time to rest and enjoy your time off from work.
