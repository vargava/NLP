Living in the city definitely has its advantages. Being able to live in the city is a privilege given the insane rent prices, so a lot of us don't waste our time. We are food-lovers, beer-lovers, dancers, party-ers, but also enjoy hanging out and watching Game of Thrones. A lot of us are into the tech/startup community so we'll try to organize some Tech talks and programming events. We have non-tech events as well - we go out together to explore nature in the SF/Bay Area and play on local amateur sports teams. We also host epic parties!

For rent is a big master bedroom with a sliding glass door to the backyard. Bedroom is currently furnished with Queen size Sleep Number bed, dresser, desk, nightstand and bookshelf. Sheets and towels can be provided as well. You would have your own bathroom with perhaps very occasional public use; as well as full use of house including two separate living rooms, huge kitchen and laundry room. I can remove furnishings you don't want.

Rent would include all utilities including internet. A TV in your bedroom would be extra, as would a landline phone. Also included are household goods such as paper towels, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, laundry soap etc.

Like to garden? I have an acre begging for some love. Great neighborhood with animals all around-horses, sheep, goats and cattle. Herds of wild turkeys are wandering around, and the deer sleep in my yard most nights. I regularly see plenty of rabbits, raccoons, possum, skunk and the occasional fox as well. Lots of birds make for great music day and night.

Now comes the catch, you knew there had to be one. . .. . ...I work and live rather odd hours. I'm normally up 'til 2 or 3 am, and I get up around 10 or 11. Combine that with 2 other issues-1. I'm a light sleeper, 2. I'm considerate to a fault; and we have a situation where I need to find someone that I won't disturb at night and won't wake me in the morning. 

Hopefully we can also come together as far as lifestyle. . .. . .I am very neat but a lousy house cleaner, so I try not to make a mess and clean as I go. An outstanding house cleaner could get a reduction in rent. Good clear communication, honesty, consideration and respect are qualities you can expect from me; I'm looking for the same.

Absolute deal breakers besides the hours:
1.	I am renting to one person only, sorry, No couples, full or part time kids, or significant others that are around all the time. Occasional overnight guests are not a problem.
2.	No pets. I have a 14 year old cat that doesn't want company, sorry.

Age and gender not important, I'm looking for the right fit.
 
Other than that. . ...let's see. . .. . .I'm a philosopher, an athlete, a musician and a nature lover. I live kind of a noisy life, so I like a peaceful place to come home to.

Ok. . .this is getting long. . .. . ..have questions? Wanna come check it out?

Utilities include a gardener.

You will pay rent and 1/3 share of utilities. One month security deposit and credit, felony, and employment checks are required: we'd rather not live with a Dark Wizard or Azkaban escapee.

6038151169,2017-03-10 11:31,http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/roo/6038151169.html,**Two Clean 1 Bdrms**12 X 10ft & 10X10'**Recently Remodeled*Avail Now*,810,san bruno,120,37.620962,-122.450352,7,"Hello. 

I have 2 bedrooms available in a 2 story, 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom house. The rooms are located on the top floor of the house in the upper hills of San Bruno. (Up there by the Church of the Highlands or past Skyline Drive (Highway 35) and Sneath Lane.) 


The rental period would be a 2 month lease, at first and then we could extend it after that. Also the room is just big enough for a single professional. Two people would be too much of a demand. Additionally, although I was looking originally for just female occupants, the current tenant is leaving so it doesn't matter any longer. However, if one female was to take the bedroom, I believe she would feel comfortable with another female, just the same. So it's kind of dependent on who takes the room first, I guess. And who they would feel comfortable with.


Well 1 bedroom measures 12 feet by 10 feet and it is situated on the top floor of the house next to two other bedrooms. The closet is about 6 feet by 2 feet. The bathroom has been completely remodeled and the bedroom itself has new lighting and a dimmer switch. And the rent for that room is $830 with a $900 deposit. Utilities are $95. So the total for that room is $925 a month.

The other bedroom is 10 feet by 10 ft which is situated right next to the other bedroom listed above. The closet space for that bedroom is 5' by 2'. And this room has brand new polished metal closet doors and a dimmer switch and newer lighting. And as you can guess, the bathroom is shared with the other occupant of the other bedroom. The rent for that room is $810 with a $900 deposit. Both rooms are available immediately. And the utilities would be $90. So a total of $900 a month for this room.


Well about the house. There are 3 rooms on the top floor along with the dining room, living room, and kitchen. There are also 2 bathrooms upstairs and a huge backyard deck off of the top floor. Downstairs there is 1 large bedroom along with the garage and laundry area. The kitchen would be shared and there is plenty of space for dishes and food.


On top of that, most of the house is undergoing remodeling. A new roof was recently completed and I will install new windows throughout most of the house as well as redo the flooring and other things throughout the house, hopefully very soon.


So I live upstairs in the master and there is one other tenant who lives downstairs in the huge bedroom. You would be renting out the 3rd bedroom upstairs and share the bathroom with just the other renter. And it would be up to your choice of who moved in with you and shared the bathroom with you.


The utilities include; access to a high efficiency washing machine and dryer, electricity, water, sewer, garbage, and AT&T broadband (Internet access.) Some paper towels and toiletries also. Just as long as you don't waste them. And I might be able to work with you on the deposit, if you needed it of course, like splitting it up between 2 months.


So whomever is seriously interested in the place, I would be happy to hold it for you as long as we click and you leave the deposit, which is non refundable. 


Well about me. I am in my early 40's, white, happy, friendly, love to be as clean and organized as I can, and have been living here for over 10 plus years. I am definitely sociable and friendly and would love to make a new friend out of this living situation. The other roommate is in his 30's, white, happy, married, and has a very friendly personality, and he is clean as well. And we definitely do NOT smoke and we have no animals and would expect the same. The kitchen would be shared and the backyard is nice for barbecuing in the summer. And it is a pretty peaceful neighborhood. 


And let me just point out three points, this is a NON-Smoking and Non-pet household. So please don't ask if you can smoke outside or if you can have a very small miniature pet. It just wouldn't work. Also, third You must clean up after yourself well. There's no way around it. In fact, that's my main concern when it comes down to finding a new tenant. So as long as you don't mind keeping the bathroom clean and wiping up after yourself when you cook or eat, I would be happy to meet with you. Also, please be happy and fun and positive minded. I would greatly appreciate that:) That allows for greater conversations and a better roommate relationship. What do you think?


The house is located in San Bruno which is about 7 minutes away from the San Francisco Internantional Airport (SFO,) 2 minutes to Highway 280, 4 minutes to Highway 101, 2 minutes to Skyline College and 15 minutes to San Mateo College, 4 minutes to Tanforan Shopping Center and 6 minutes to Serramonte Shopping Center, and 15-25 minutes to downtown San Francisco and about 25-35-45 minutes to different parts of Silicon Valley, like for instance Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, or downtown San Jose. So as you can see, the house is centrally located and pretty close to most parts of the bay area. Also there are many parks, walking trails, reservoirs, and beaches very close by. Like within a few minutes or so.


Also just for the record, You Can Not Pay the last month's rent with the deposit. You would pay the last month's rent and then I would have to return your deposit within 21 days after all the bills have been accounted for. 


Also if you break the lease for whatever reason, you will lose your deposit! There are no exceptions, so please plan on living here for your agreement or losing your deposit. Sorry. 


Well if you are interested and would like to find out a little bit more about the place, please feel free to call me. But please no later than 10 p.m. and no earlier than 10 a.m. You can reach me at 
 
and I would be happy to answer any questions not listed in this ad.

There's ample street parking (seriously super easy to park & street cleaners are every other week on some streets), and negotiable designated parking for the apt if needed, but unfortunately no washer and dryer. 

The room: is spacious at 10' 9"" x 9' 6"" (not including closet). You also get a fairly large closet (7'0"" x 2'10"").

No cooking, no overnight guests, no bathroom, no parking, no living... So ridiculous. Fuck that noise.

If you want to live in a sweet house, with a giant kitchen, a large pool-sized garden, dinner parties, couchsurfers, chickens, and more, you may have just found your new home.

We're looking for a stellar person that wants to interact with their housemates. We're not party animals, and this isn't the type of place where there will be noise at all hours. We all have jobs, we're all professionals, but we also like to have social lives and have friends over. We hope you are of a similar mindset.

About us:
We are clean, respectful professionals in our 30s. We are a mix of males and females. We work at places ranging from the tech industry to the public sector. We've all been to Burning Man and are crafty, music and dance loving, camping types. Can find us on the weekends pickling vegetables or making kombucha, designing new cocktail robots, sewing costumes, dancing samba, or just hanging out together watching movies. 

About the place:
We've been living in a five bedroom house on the border of Cupertino for the last two years. It's gone from a sterile empty place to a home full of life. There is a garage workshop, DJ station, crafting area, comfy living room with projector, a big garden in the back with the friendliest chickens you'll ever meet, and great roommates.

There is one room which is becoming available starting March 1st. The rent is $825 (86 sq ft). The security deposit is $1500. Three rooms share two bathrooms (one full and one half). We have been sharing for the past two years and never run into any issues with getting ready for work even when we have extra guests staying over. The room can be furnished if requested with a queen bed, dresser, and bookshelves. Our lease is for five people in the house. Sorry, no couples.

About you:
Over 25 and under 45. 
Clean, respectful, and have the means to pay the rent on time.
Don't have pets. Seriously. You can't have any pets. 
Can sign a 1 year lease.
You are awesome or are working on it. :)

The space:
Spacious house with lots of light and abundant storage space in the basement (unfurnished) for things like bikes/skis/camping equipment etc. It is a 3 bedroom/2 bath house, with a living room, dining room and very large kitchen. The kitchen was fully remodeled 1.5 years ago with all new appliances, dishwasher, washer/dryer etc. There is a
fantastic front porch and also a shared back deck with our neighbors (it is on a split lot). You can always be on a deck with sunshine if that is your desire!

The room:
The open room is one of the rooms that uses the shared bath. It is a relatively small room - the bed pictured is a queen, but it doesn't leave a ton of extra space for dressers etc. The main window opens to lovely trees/plants. The closet is relatively deep, but not huge

The roommates
We are a friendly household - like to hang out and share meals and a beer or glass of wine if we are around, but also each have our own thing going. 

One male, late 20s, works in biotech, likes to cook and active doing things like climbing and snowboarding. 

On female, mid 30s, works with sustainable supply chains, spends a lot of time biking, camping, and things of the like. This is who you would share the bathrooom with (the master bedroom has its own).

within walking distance to coffee shops, bars, restaurants, Piedmont
Grocery, bike shops etc etc. It is about 1.2 miles from Bart. If you

Share a kitchen with 4 others. We all rarely use the kitchen and keep it clear most of the time.. Share a bathroom with a 33 year old male. We are looking preferably a person who is quiet and respectful and clean.. we are all laid back people who work odd hours. We are coming and going all day long. We all split the utilities. Rent is $1000.00 a month plus 100 to 150$ utilities a month. Room will be available March 16th..
Everyone is 420 friendly but you will rarely ever see or smell it.
Older Russian landlords who will want to do credit check and interview before moving in.
Overall this is a great house.
Looking for long term renter but month to month is OK.
We are all in our young 30's so weekends sometimes might be louder after 10pm Friday and Saturday night. But rarely. 
House share with 3 males and one female.

The only cons are there is no laundry machines. No central heater. And you share walls with all 4 people. The landlords don't really help out much either (takes forever for something to get done). You must be quite after 10pm and respectful entering and leaving the room during the evening. Carpets are ehhh OK in your room. No pets aloud.

Pros are you can see the tip of the golden gate bridge from your room on a clear day. Decent size room for SF. 12' by 12' I believe ? There is always free parking. Irving Street is only 4 blocks down the hill. Bus stop in front of house. Decent size closet space. Everyone is very friendly and rarely at the house.
